# Karabiner Elements .config files

[Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) is a keymap customizer for MacOS.
It can be used to customize key layouts for built-in Macbook keyboards and other keyboards whose firmwares cannot be remapped e.g. using [qmk](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) (although, find my qmk fork [here](https://github.com/mikedecr/qmk_firmware)).
